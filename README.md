# petpet-bot

i got bored

a decent bit of this code is from Vencord's [petpet plugin](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/src/plugins/petpet/index.ts)

makeLazy is from [utils/lazy.ts](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord/blob/main/src/utils/lazy.ts)

it doesn't have many options but i just wanted to migrate it into a bot

make a config.json containing
```json5
{
  "token": "bot-token" // exclude Bot from it, added in code
}
```
